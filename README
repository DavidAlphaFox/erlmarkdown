Release Notes
=============

Version 1.0 Production Release
------------------------------

This is a major rewrite. There is little point writing servers-side markdown
without a client-side markdown to preview it.

This markdown will now track showdown from Attack Labs as its twin 
implementation.

<http://attacklab.net/showdown/>

To that end the test suite has been repurposed to test
compatibility with showdown. The current release of showdown used is V0.9

The directory `/tests` now contains an webpage `index.html` which generates
the tests (ie the file `markdown_tests.erl` in `/src`).

`index.html` loads a javascript file `generate_tests.js` which holds a list of 
strings which it generates the tests from (ie testing if markdown produces the
same output as showdown...)

There are a number of places where markdown is not *whitespace compatible* with showdown - you can inspect these by looking for commented out tests in 
`generate_tests.js`. There are also a number of showdown bugs or other 
inconsistencies which also show up as commented out tests in 
`generate_tests.js`.

The biggest single difference is that showdown doesn't escape any html tags
by default whereas markdown has a whitelist of blocklevel tags which it doesn't
escape (see the function `markdown:is_block_tag/1`).

(Other) Known Bugs and Errata:
as per the previous versions (see bottom of document)

There are 261 Unit Tests.

Version 1.0 RC1.1 First Point Release
-------------------------------------

Various bug fixes:
* supports short inline URL references of the form 'some text [id] some more'
* fixes bugs with lines containing markdown only like '#', '>', '=' and '-'
* fixes a bug where a terminating '\n\n' would mean each line came back reversed
* fixes various 'atx header' bugs
* fixes bugs where lines start with an emphasis or strong marker (thanks to Tom McNulty)

Unit tests bumped up to 255.

Version 1.0 RC1 Production Release Candidate
--------------------------------------------

This version comes with 226 Unit Tests and is being released for pre-production testing.

It also has 1 System Test - this document :)

Known Bugs And Errata
=====================

1  This is a valid markdown for references
------------------------------------------

    [id]: http://sub.dom.tld:1234/some/path\\t\\n(Title)

The title wrap to a new line is not supported in this release.

2 Character Escaping
--------------------

I'm not entirely clear how character escaping should work for:

    \   backslash
    \`   backtick
    *   asterisk
    _   underscore
    {}  curly braces
    []  square brackets
    ()  parentheses
    #   hash mark
    +   plus sign
    -   minus sign (hyphen)
    .   dot
    !   exclamation mark

I escape them only in context.

3 Anti-spam mailto's
--------------------

The official release obfuscated e-mail addresses, this don't :(
