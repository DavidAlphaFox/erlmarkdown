Errata
======

1  This is a valid markdown for references
------------------------------------------

    [id]: http://sub.dom.tld:1234/some/path\\t\\n(Title)

The title wrap to a new line is not supported in this release.

2 Character Escaping
--------------------

I'm not entirely clear how character escaping should work for:

    \   backslash
    \`   backtick
    *   asterisk
    _   underscore
    {}  curly braces
    []  square brackets
    ()  parentheses
    #   hash mark
    +   plus sign
    -   minus sign (hyphen)
    .   dot
    !   exclamation mark

I escape them only in context.

3 Anti-spam mailto's
--------------------

The official release obfuscated e-mail addresses, this don't :(
